\chapter{Engineering Design}

Although engineering drawing still plays an important role in product design and manufacturing in many industrial sectors around the world, manual sketching for creating drawings has been gradually replaced by CAD (computer-aided design) software using computers. Beginning in the 1980s, CAD software reduced the need for draftsmen significantly, especially in small to mid-sized companies. The softwareâ€™s affordability and ability to run on personal computers in the mid-1990s allowed engineers to do their own drafting and analytic work to some extent \ref{eq:1}.
